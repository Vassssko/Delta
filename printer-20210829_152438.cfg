# Common kinematic settings
[printer]
kinematics: delta
max_velocity: 500
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 10000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel: 10000
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

## Linear Delta Kinematics

#Only parameters specific to linear delta printers are described here -
#see [common kinematic settings](#common-kinematic-settings) for
#available parameters.

#max_z_velocity: 500
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
minimum_z_position: -10
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to. The default is 0.
#delta_radius: 167.86
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.
print_radius: 120
#   The radius (in mm) of valid toolhead XY coordinates. One may use
#   this setting to customize the range checking of toolhead moves. If
#   a large value is specified here then it may be possible to command
#   the toolhead into a collision with a tower. The default is to use
#   delta_radius for print_radius (which would normally prevent a
#   tower collision).

[stepper_a]
#position_endstop: 410
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstop triggers. This
#   parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for stepper_b and
#   stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value specified for
#   stepper_a.
#arm_length: 337.59
#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rod that connects this tower to the
#   print head. This parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for
#   stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
homing_speed: 100.0


[extruder]
nozzle_diameter: 0.4
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.
filament_diameter: 1.75
#   The nominal diameter of the raw filament (in mm) as it enters the
#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#instantaneous_corner_velocity: 1.000
#   The maximum instantaneous velocity change (in mm/s) of the
#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:

[extruder]
#control: pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
#pid_Kp: 30
#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#pid_Ki: 2
#   Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be
#   provided for PID heaters.
#pid_Kd: 113
#   Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#pid_integral_max:
#   The maximum "windup" the integral term may accumulate. The default
#   is to use the same value as max_power.
