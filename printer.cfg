[printer]
kinematics: delta
max_velocity: 500
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 10000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel: 10000
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

## Linear Delta Kinematics

#Only parameters specific to linear delta printers are described here -
#see [common kinematic settings](#common-kinematic-settings) for
#available parameters.

#max_z_velocity: 500
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
minimum_z_position: -5
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to. The default is 0.
#delta_radius: 167.86
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.
print_radius: 120
#   The radius (in mm) of valid toolhead XY coordinates. One may use
#   this setting to customize the range checking of toolhead moves. If
#   a large value is specified here then it may be possible to command
#   the toolhead into a collision with a tower. The default is to use
#   delta_radius for print_radius (which would normally prevent a
#   tower collision).

[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
#retract_speed: 20
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
#unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.
